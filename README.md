Hope you like it!

## 2. How to install

### Download from Release Page

[Download here](https://github.com/jerryuhoo/Fire/releases/latest)

### Build by JUCE

Open .jucer file by Projucer then select your IDE to build 『Fire』. If you don't have projucer, you can go to JUCE/extras/Projucer/Builds/... and build it, or download from the [latest JUCE release](https://www.juce.com)

Note: You should choose Release mode rather than Debug mode(or disable Debug mode) in .fire Exporters page. Build with debug mode will cause high CPU usage.

## 3. User Manual

『Fire』has a top panel, a spectrogram, four graph visualizers, band effect, and global effect.

### 3.1. Top panel

* HQ: 4x oversampling for high quality audio.
* A/B: switch between A/B to compare.
* Copy: copy current preset parameters to another(A/B) panel.
* Preset bar: choose your current preset.
* Save: save your preset to user folder.
* Menu: other settings including init, open preset folder, rescan preset folder, open GitHub page, check for new version.

### 3.2. Spectrogram

* You can split up frequency to four bands for multiband distortion.

### 3.3. Graph Visualizer

* There are four graph visualizers. You can click on each graph to zoom in or zoom out.
* Top left is oscilloscope.
* Top right is distortion graph.
* Buttom Left is VU meters.
* Buttom right is Width graph.

### 3.4. Band Effect

* You can click four switches on the right side of graphs.

* Drive:『Fire』 has several distortion functions. There are three buttons "L", "S", "E", related to drive knob, and each means "Link", "Safe", and "Extreme". 
    * "L" (Link): When your turn up drive knob, the output knob value will automatically reduce. 
    * "S" (Safe): If your drive knob pushes your volume too loud, it will automatically reduce your drive value. It also shows reduced value on drive knob.
    * "E" (Extreme): It expands the range of the the drive knob (from around +40db to around +60db) when it is enabled to give more distortion.

* Retification and bias: Change your distortion shape.

* Compressor: you can change threshold and ratio for each band.

* Width: change audio width.

* Output and mix: for band control.

### 3.5. Global Effect

* Filter: you can set lowcut, highcut, and peak. Lowcut and highcut each has four slopes (12, 24, 36, 48) you can choose.

* Downsample: downsample your audio.

* Limiter: add a limiter after distortion.

* Output and mix: for global control.
