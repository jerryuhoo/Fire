# TODO

- Bug

1. Cutoff Q not working
(except can't repaint distortion graph when bypassed, and won't be fixed because cannot get sample max value when bypassed)

- Feature

1. add enable button for compressor, downsample, width, filter, etc.
2. auto-update check when open
3. dry mix compensation
4. add mid-side / pan knobs
5. add solo button between vertical lines
6. mouse drag vertically to change the output volume, like Ozone or saturn2
7. smooth spectrogram
8. add lfo control
9. change A/B color when switching
10. add max input/output value for meters (currently RMS)

- Improvement

1. reduce paint CPU usage
